find fractions
---
in these programs you can find the fraction a decimal number belongs to
but the fraction found isn't about the right number written by the user

the programs works with the fractions knowing that them are rounded
for example, if i write 1.142857143, the programs doesn't find 
1142857143/1000000000, but it finds 8/7.

in the program find_fr_to_import.py there may be some modifies that there aren't
in find_fraction.py, because sometimes the one to import gets some uploads to get
optimized with all the other programs.
