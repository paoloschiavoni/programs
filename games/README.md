# PROGRAMS

all these games work thanks to the images in their folders.
be careful to change the path of all the images in this way:
 1. copy the path of an image (which is the same for all them)
 2. in the beginning of the main program of the game, there is a list o paths,
 replace them with the new path, keeping at the end the name of the image with its extension.
 3. if there are some "\" replace all them with "/".

 ---
 be careful: remember to keep the " " before and after the path.
